# My City | Cluj Napoca
Milestone 1 Project User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is the website I created to promote my city. Cluj Napoca is a city in full swing both from an economic and tourist point of view. Potential readers will find out new things about this area of Transylvania and photos and video images will make them at least curious to visit the city. The project was made possible with the support of Cluj Napoca City Hall.
